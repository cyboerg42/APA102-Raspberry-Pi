How to build frames :

It's simple.

Each LED got a RED, BLUE and GREEN Value. Right? Right.


RED GREEN BLUE RED GREEN BLUE ..... RED GREEN BLUE
FF 00 00 FF 00 00 FF 00 00 ..... FF 00 00

But every frame must have 300 of those (FF 00 00) Blocks. More will be ignored. Less will eventually crash. 
Beside you don't change the code.

That's all. Simple and tidy. :)
